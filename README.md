The Z80 Clock and Reset board provides a variable astable clock where the frequency can be controlled by R8 or a monostable clock to allow the clock to be "single-stepped". The switch S1 toggles between the astable and monostable clock. Additional the switch S3 provides a reset signal for use with the Z80.

## Objective
Support Z80 CPU learning, specifically used with associated [Z80 CPU](https://github.com/rabs664/Z80-CPU), [Z80 Memory](https://github.com/rabs664/Z80-Memory) and [Z80 Bus Monitor](https://github.com/rabs664/Z80-Bus-Monitor) Boards.

## Background
Used extensively during early Z80 learning to single step the clock or slow run the clock and watch the Z80 activity using the [Z80 Bus Monitor](https://github.com/rabs664/Z80-Bus-Monitor) Board.

## Testing
The Z80 Clock and Reset V1.2 board has been built and tested.
